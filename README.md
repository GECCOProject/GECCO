# GECCO
## Reproducibility
To reproduce the results in the GECCO paper, the practitioner should change the featurelength (hidden size) of the model in the model.py file. For MNIST, MSTAR, use featurelength=32, MSTAR, use a featurelength of 48, and CXR, use a featurelength of 56. 
Additionally, update the directories in the code to match the datasets in your own workspace.
